I'm working on systems research including networking, storage, and operating
systems.
In January 2020, I started as Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the [School of
Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk).
Before that, I was at NEC Labs Europe (2012-2014 and 2016-2019) and in [ATG](https://www.netapp.com/us/company/leadership/advanced-technology/index.aspx)
at [NetApp](https://www.netapp.com) (2014-2016).
I finished my PhD in 2012 at Keio University in Japan, during which I was
a visiting student researcher at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/) in
2010, and an intern at Nokia Research Center in 2008.

One of my active projects is [PASTE, co-designing network and storage
stack for persistent memory systems](https://micchie.github.io/paste). I am also working on storage and
network support for machine learning applications.
