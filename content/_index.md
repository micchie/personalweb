<!--<span style="font-style: oblique">I will be joining School of Informatics at <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk">University of Edinburgh</a> as Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in January 2020</span>-->

I'm working on systems research including networking, storage, and operating
systems.
In January 2020, I started as Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the <a
href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics">School of Informatics</a> at the <a
href="https://www.ed.ac.uk">University of Edinburgh</a>.
Before that, I was at NEC Labs Europe (2012-2014 and 2016-2019) and in <a
href="https://www.netapp.com/us/company/leadership/advanced-technology/index.aspx">ATG
</a> at <a href="https://www.netapp.com">NetApp</a> (2014-2016).
I finished my PhD in 2012 at <a class="txt" href="https://www.keio.ac.jp/index-en.html">Keio University</a> in Japan, during which I was
a visiting student researcher at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/">UCL</a> in
2010, and an intern at Nokia Research Center in 2008.

One of my active projects is <a href="https://micchie.github.io/paste/">PASTE, co-designing network and storage
stack for persistent memory systems</a>. I am also working on storage and
network support for machine learning applications.
