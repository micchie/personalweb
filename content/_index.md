I do systems research in NEC Laboratories Europe at Heidelberg. I moved <span style="font-style: italic">back</span> here on November 2016 from <a href="http://www.netapp.com/us/company/leadership/advanced-technology/index.aspx">Advanced Technology Group (ATG)</a> of NetApp where I worked for two years in Munich.  I finished my PhD in March 2012 at <a class="txt" href="http://www.keio.ac.jp/index-en.html">Keio University</a>, Japan.
I am broadly interested in networked systems.
<!--&nbsp;My research is funded by <a class="txt" href="http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/index.html">Research Fellowships of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science for Young Scientists</a>.   -->
In 2008 I joined <a href="http://research.nokia.com/">Nokia Research Center, Espoo, Finland</a> as an intern, and in 2010 I joined <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London (UCL)</a> as a visiting student researcher.
