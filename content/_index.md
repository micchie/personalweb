I'm working on systems research including networking, storage, and operating
systems.
In January 2020, I started as Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Networked
Systems at the [School of
Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) of the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk).
Before that, I was at NEC Labs Europe (2012-2014 and 2016-2019) and in [ATG](https://www.netapp.com/us/company/leadership/advanced-technology/index.aspx)
at [NetApp](https://www.netapp.com) (2014-2016).
I finished my PhD in 2012 at Keio University in Japan, during which I was
a visiting student researcher at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/) in
2010, and an intern at Nokia Research Center in 2008.

Current projects include [PASTE, co-designing network and storage
stack for persistent memory](https://micchie.github.io/paste), and [designing a storage and network stack for SoC-based accelerator devices](files/hotstorage20-hayagui.pdf).
