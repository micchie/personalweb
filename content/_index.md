I finished my PhD in March 2012 at <a class="txt" href="http://www.keio.ac.jp/index-en.html">Keio University</a>, Japan.
In 2008 I joined Nokia Research Center in Finland as an intern, and in 2010 I was at <a href="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London (UCL)</a> as a visiting student researcher.
